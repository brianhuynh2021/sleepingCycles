# sleepingCycles
Our human body sleeping circle is long as 90 mins to 120 mins. This is a program that how many circles you want to sleep and what time would you must wake up.
# Here I want to current time plus with total hours I need to sleep
#example now is 0 hours, I want to sleep 2 circles = 180 mins = 3 hours - the restult will say: you need to
# wake up at 4.00 o'clock
#Otherwise, if you want to set up a time to sleep by your own, so this program also help you to do that by asking you would like to sleep now or later. If you now it could be give you immidiately the time you would need to wake up, else you need give the time want to go to sleep and it will computer time and give to you the time you would go to bed.
#Hope you have a good description of this program.
